# Living Lanier

> Living Lanier is a React web application that connects buyers/sellers of homes specifically located on Lake Lanier to the Lanier Life Group Real Estate agency. 

<!-- > Auto Pasture is a fullstack web application that connects buyers to vehicles that are otherwise not listed on other mainstream marketplaces. Auto Pasture gives back the power to users with easy and simplified vehicle searches that connects them to sellers based on their own custom search parameters. This application includes a full gamut of features including everything from authentication, geolocation services, heavy usage of custom API queries and error handing of inconsistent data.

## 🌎 Motivation
- Coming Soon!
<!-- >Full-Stack Web application that profiles advanced features of React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails API with its perspective [Github Repository](https://github.com/bavarianrhino/vehicle_search_rails_backend) if you desire to see the code. RESTfully persists user data with postgreSQL database via Active Record implementing a has-many-through model relationship along with full CRUD actions. -->


## 🎬 Demo
- Coming Soon!

<!-- * Communicate data via <b>RESTful API</b> from the <b>PostgreSQL</b> database to the Client React Application -->
<!-- * Understand how to route user requests on the front end with <b>React Router</b> and on the backend with <b>Active Record</b> -->
<!-- * Enhance authentication flows in the app with the Ruby gems <b>Bcrypt & JWT for Authentication</b> -->
<!-- * Build reusable user inputs with <b>Redux Form</b>, complete with navigation -->
<!-- * Handle credit cards and receive payments from users with <b>Stripe</b> -->
<!-- * Engage users with automated <b>emails</b> -->
<!-- * Separate production and development resources with advanced <b>API key handling techniques</b> -->
<!-- * Educate users on how to use the app with custom build landing pages -->
